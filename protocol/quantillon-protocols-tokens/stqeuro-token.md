### Yield-Bearing Mechanics

**🔄  Token Architecture**

**Auto-Compounding Model**

Unlike traditional staking where users must manually claim rewards, stQEURO automatically increases in intrinsic value over time. The quantity of stQEURO tokens in user wallets remains constant, but each token becomes worth more QEURO as yields accumulate.

```
stQEURO Value Growth = 1 stQEURO = (1 + Cumulative Yield Rate) QEURO

Example:
Day 0: Stake 1,000 QEURO → Receive 1,000 stQEURO (1 stQEURO = 1 QEURO)
Day 365: Still hold 1,000 stQEURO, but 1 stQEURO = 1.053 QEURO (5.3% APY)
When unstaking: 1,000 stQEURO → 1,053 QEURO
```

**📊 Yield Calculation Formula**

```
Daily Value Appreciation = Current Exchange Rate × (1 + Daily Yield Rate)

Where:
- Exchange Rate: How much QEURO each stQEURO is worth
- Daily Yield Rate: (Aave APY - Protocol Fees - Hedger Compensation) ÷ 365
```

**⚡ Key Benefits**:

* **No Token Inflation**: stQEURO quantity remains fixed in wallets
* **Value Appreciation**: Each stQEURO becomes worth more QEURO over time
* **Composable**: Use stQEURO in other DeFi protocols while value appreciates
* **Tax Efficient**: No rebase events creating potential taxable income
