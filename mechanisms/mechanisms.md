## Mechanisms

Understanding how Quantillon Protocol operates is essential for both users and developers. This comprehensive guide breaks down the core mechanisms that power QEURO‚Äîfrom the dual-pool architecture and overcollateralization model to the innovative Yield Shift system that maintains peg stability while generating sustainable returns.

***

### üèóÔ∏è Protocol Architecture Overview

Quantillon Protocol represents a paradigm shift in stablecoin design, combining the capital efficiency of overcollateralized systems with the liquidity advantages of forex markets. At its core, the protocol operates through interconnected mechanisms that ensure peg stability, yield generation, and capital efficiency.

#### Core Design Principles

* **üîí Over-collateralization**: Minimum 101% backing ensures systemic stability
* **‚öñÔ∏è Delta-neutral hedging**: FX risk is distributed across willing participants
* **üìà Dynamic yield distribution**: Market-responsive incentive alignment
* **üåä Liquidity inheritance**: Leverages existing USDC and forex market depth
* **üèõÔ∏è Decentralized governance**: Community-controlled parameter management

***

### üí∂ QEURO Stablecoin Mechanics

#### Minting Process

The QEURO minting mechanism is designed for simplicity and capital efficiency:

**üì• Step-by-Step Minting**

1. **Asset Deposit**: Users deposit accepted ERC-20 tokens (USDC, ETH, WBTC, etc.)
2. **Automatic Routing**: Protocol routes deposits through integrated DEX for optimal pricing
3. **USDC Conversion**: All deposits are automatically converted to USDC collateral
4. **Oracle Price Check**: Chainlink oracles provide real-time EUR/USD exchange rates
5. **QEURO Issuance**: Users receive QEURO at current oracle price minus 0.1% minting fee
6. **Collateral Lock**: USDC is deposited into yield-generating vaults (Aave, Maker, etc.)

```
Example Minting Transaction:
User deposits: 1,000 USDC
EUR/USD rate: 1.10
Minting fee: 0.1% = 1 USDC
Net collateral: 999 USDC
QEURO received: 999 √∑ 1.10 = 908.18 QEURO
```

**‚ö° Key Features**

* **Zero slippage** minting at oracle rates
* **Instant settlement** within one block
* **Permissionless access** 24/7 availability
* **Multi-asset support** for user convenience

#### Redemption Process

Redemption operates as the inverse of minting, ensuring users can always exit at fair value:

**üì§ Step-by-Step Redemption**

1. **QEURO Burn**: Users submit QEURO for redemption
2. **Oracle Verification**: Current EUR/USD rate determines USD value
3. **Collateral Release**: Equivalent USDC withdrawn from vaults
4. **Fee Deduction**: 0.1% redemption fee applied
5. **USDC Transfer**: Net USDC transferred to user wallet

```
Example Redemption Transaction:
User redeems: 900 QEURO
EUR/USD rate: 1.08
USD value: 900 √ó 1.08 = 972 USDC
Redemption fee: 0.1% = 0.97 USDC
Net USDC received: 971.03 USDC
```

### üé≠ Dual-Pool Architecture

The innovative dual-pool system is what sets Quantillon apart from traditional stablecoins. It creates natural peg stability through aligned economic incentives rather than relying solely on arbitrage.

#### üë• Users Pool

Users are participants who mint and hold QEURO for euro exposure and yield generation.

**User Motivations**

* **üá™üá∫ Native Euro Exposure**: Eliminate EUR/USD volatility risk
* **üìà Yield Generation**: Earn returns through staking mechanisms
* **üîó DeFi Access**: Participate in euro-denominated DeFi strategies
* **üíº Treasury Management**: Corporate and institutional euro liquidity

**User Mechanics**

* Mint QEURO against accepted collateral
* Stake QEURO to earn variable APY from Yield Shift
* Participate in governance through staked positions
* Redeem anytime at oracle-determined rates

#### üõ°Ô∏è Hedgers Pool

Hedgers provide the delta-neutral backbone that maintains peg stability while earning compensation for EUR/USD exposure.

**Hedger Function**

Hedgers essentially take **long EUR/USD positions** in exchange for:

* Interest rate differential compensation (typically \~1% annually)
* Variable Yield Shift bonuses based on supply/demand
* Protocol fee sharing when activated

**Hedger Entry Process**

1. **Deposit USDC**: Provide USD-denominated liquidity
2. **Leverage Selection**: Choose exposure level (typically 2-10x)
3. **Margin Requirements**: Maintain minimum collateralization ratio
4. **Yield Participation**: Earn compensation from multiple sources

**Risk Management**

* **Liquidation Threshold**: Automatic liquidation if margin ratio falls below 101%
* **Dynamic Pricing**: Real-time EUR/USD exposure pricing via Chainlink
* **Position Limits**: Maximum exposure limits prevent concentration risk

#### üîÑ Pool Interaction Dynamics

The dual pools create a symbiotic relationship:

```
Users ‚Üê‚Üí Protocol ‚Üê‚Üí Hedgers
  ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
Euro      USDC      USD
Exposure  Backing   Risk
```

* **Users** get euro exposure without FX risk
* **Hedgers** assume FX risk for yield compensation
* **Protocol** maintains stability through balanced incentives

***

### üìä Overcollateralization Model

Quantillon uses overcollateralization‚Äîmeaning that the value of assets held in reserves is greater than the pegged value‚Äîto mitigate the inherent volatility of the underlying forex markets.

#### Collateralization Requirements

**Minimum Ratios**

* **Users**: 101% minimum collateralization
* **Hedgers**: 101% margin requirement
* **Protocol**: Dynamic buffer based on volatility

**Liquidation Mechanisms**

**User Liquidations:**

* Triggered when collateral value falls below 101% of QEURO debt
* Automatic execution via Chainlink price feeds
* 5% liquidation penalty to maintain protocol health
* Liquidated collateral sold to cover debt and penalties

**Hedger Liquidations:**

* Triggered when margin ratio falls below 101%
* EUR/USD movement against hedger positions
* Automated liquidation bot network ensures rapid execution
* Liquidation penalty redistributed to remaining hedgers

#### Collateral Management

**Accepted Collateral Types**

* **USDC**: Primary collateral for direct backing
* **ETH**: Blue-chip cryptocurrency with high liquidity
* **WBTC**: Wrapped Bitcoin for portfolio diversification
* **Additional assets**: Approved through governance voting

**Vault Deployment Strategy**

| Vault Type | Collateral Backend  | Risk Profile | Target APY |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **aQEURO** | Aave USDC lending   | Low          | 3-7%       |
| **mQEURO** | MakerDAO DSR/PSM    | Very Low     | 2-5%       |
| **bQEURO** | Tokenized T-Bills   | Low          | 4-6%       |
| **eQEURO** | Advanced strategies | Medium       | 5-12%      |

### ‚öñÔ∏è The Yield Shift Mechanism

The Yield Shift represents Quantillon's most innovative feature‚Äîa dynamic system that automatically rebalances yield distribution based on market conditions.

#### Mathematical Foundation

The Yield Shift operates on a continuous rebalancing formula:

**Base Variables**

* **R** = Total yield from collateral deployment
* **H** = Hedger pool utilization ratio (0-100%)
* **U** = User pool demand ratio
* **Œ±** = Governance-defined sensitivity parameter

**Distribution Formula**

```
Hedger Yield = min(Interest_Rate_Differential + (Yield_Shift √ó R), Max_Hedger_Yield)
User Yield = R - Hedger_Yield - Protocol_Fee(10%)
Yield_Shift = Œ± √ó (Target_H - Current_H) / Target_H
```

Where:

* **Target\_H** = Optimal hedger pool ratio (typically 30-50%)
* **Current\_H** = Actual hedger participation level
* **Œ±** = Sensitivity coefficient (0.1 - 2.0)

#### Dynamic Rebalancing Examples

**Scenario 1: Excess Hedger Supply**

* **Situation**: Hedger utilization = 80% (above target 50%)
* **Yield Shift**: Negative ‚Üí More yield flows to Users
* **Result**: Attracts more QEURO demand, rebalances pools

**Scenario 2: Insufficient Hedgers**

* **Situation**: Hedger utilization = 20% (below target 50%)
* **Yield Shift**: Positive ‚Üí More yield flows to Hedgers
* **Result**: Attracts delta-neutral capital, strengthens peg

**Scenario 3: Balanced Pools**

* **Situation**: Hedger utilization = 50% (at target)
* **Yield Shift**: Neutral ‚Üí Standard distribution
* **Result**: Stable yields for both user groups

#### Real-Time Adjustment Mechanics

The Yield Shift updates **continuously** based on:

1. **üìä Pool Utilization**: Real-time hedger/user ratios
2. **üí± FX Volatility**: EUR/USD movement amplifies shifts
3. **üè¶ Collateral Performance**: Underlying yield changes
4. **‚öñÔ∏è Governance Parameters**: Community-set bounds and targets
