# QTI Token

## 🎨 Design and Inflation <a href="#design-and-inflation" id="design-and-inflation"></a>

QTI's total initial supply is 1 billion and there is no planned token inflation.

The only address with minting capability is the Quantillon Governor Multisig.

## 🧬 Tokenomics <a href="#tokenomics" id="tokenomics"></a>

The QTI token is the backbone of the Quantillon Protocol allowing it to be governed in a fully decentralized way.

The vision for the QTI distribution was that it needed to be multi-year, extended, and sustainable until the protocol reaches ubiquity. With this in mind, the token distribution is broken down as follows:

### 🪐 Liquidity Mining <a href="#liquidity-mining" id="liquidity-mining"></a>

60% of tokens are being distributed for Quantillon stablecoins holders via liquidity mining.

### Quantillon Labs team and early backers <a href="#angle-labs-team-and-early-backers" id="angle-labs-team-and-early-backers"></a>

These tokens are subject to a **linear vesting of 4 years**

* 20% to Quantillon Labs team members
* 20% to early backers

With this vesting schedule, liquidity distributed through liquidity mining to the Community is guaranteed to be bigger than that going to team and early backers.
