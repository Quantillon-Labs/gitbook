# Quantillon Protocol's tokens

## Quantillon Protocol's Token Ecosystem

### 📋 Overview

Quantillon Protocol operates through a sophisticated three-token architecture designed to create a comprehensive euro-native DeFi ecosystem. Each token serves a distinct purpose within our protocol while maintaining synergistic relationships that drive sustainable growth, decentralized governance, and optimal capital efficiency.

Our tokenomic design reflects years of research into successful DeFi protocols, incorporating proven mechanisms from projects like MakerDAO, Aave, and Curve while innovating specifically for the European market's unique regulatory and user requirements.

### 🏗️ Three-Token Architecture

**The Quantillon Token Ecosystem**

**💶** [**QEURO (Euro Stablecoin)**](qeuro-token.md)\
Our euro-pegged stablecoin built on innovative dual-pool architecture with overcollateralized USDC backing. QEURO provides euro exposure with USD liquidity depth while generating sustainable yields through battle-tested DeFi protocols.

**📈** [**stQEURO (Yield-Bearing Euro Token)**](stqeuro-token.md)\
The yield-bearing wrapper that automatically compounds returns from QEURO collateral deployment. stQEURO offers set-and-forget euro yield generation with full liquidity and cross-protocol composability.\
\
**🏛️** [**QTI (Quantillon Governance Token)**](qti-token.md)\
The protocol's governance backbone, enabling decentralized decision-making through vote-escrow mechanics, dynamic reward systems, and progressive decentralization. QTI holders control protocol parameters, treasury allocation, and strategic direction.\

### 🔄 Token Synergies & Interactions

**Interconnected Value Creation**

```
Protocol Value Flow:
QEURO Operations → Yield Generation → stQEURO Auto-Compounding
        ↓                ↓                     ↓
   Fee Revenue → QTI Governance → Parameter Optimization
        ↓                ↓                     ↓
   Treasury Growth → Ecosystem Development → User Benefits
```

**Governance Integration**: QTI holders vote on yield distribution parameters affecting stQEURO returns and QEURO stability mechanisms.

**Economic Alignment**: Protocol fees from QEURO operations fund QTI staker rewards while optimizing stQEURO yield generation.

**Sustainable Growth**: Each token's success reinforces the others, creating positive feedback loops for long-term ecosystem development.

### 📊 Economic Sustainability Model

**Revenue Generation & Distribution**

Our tokenomics create multiple sustainable revenue streams that benefit all ecosystem participants:

**Primary Revenue Sources**:

* QEURO mint/redeem fees (0.1% on operations)
* Yield management fees (10% of collateral returns)
* Liquidation penalties (2-5% of liquidated positions)
* Cross-chain bridge fees (0.1-0.3% of transfers)

### 📚 Documentation Structure

Each token in our ecosystem has dedicated comprehensive documentation covering:

**🏛️ QTI Token**: Governance mechanisms, vote-escrow systems, emission schedules, and participation incentives

**💶 QEURO Token**: Stablecoin mechanics, dual-pool architecture, vault variants, and regulatory compliance

**📈 stQEURO Token**: Yield-bearing functionality, compounding mechanics, cross-protocol composability, and risk management

These detailed specifications provide everything needed for users, developers, and institutions to understand and integrate with the Quantillon Protocol ecosystem.

***

> **Getting Started**: New users should begin with QEURO for euro exposure, add stQEURO for yield generation, and acquire QTI for governance participation. Each token serves specific use cases while contributing to overall ecosystem value and sustainability.
