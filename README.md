> **A euro-native DeFi infrastructure — robust, compliant, and built for composability.**

## 🧭 Welcome to the Quantillon Protocol Documentation

**Quantillon Protocol** is a decentralized finance infrastructure designed to unlock the power of the euro in crypto ecosystems. While the USD dominates DeFi, Quantillon provides a stable, scalable, and euro-denominated solution to serve individuals, institutions, and protocols across Europe and beyond.

Built on top of **robust USD liquidity**, the protocol issues **$QEURO**, a euro stablecoin backed by stable USD reserves (e.g. USDC) with real-time risk-managed FX exposure. The protocol is governed by a decentralized community via the **$QTI** governance token.

## 🎯 What is Quantillon Protocol?

Quantillon Protocol is a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem built around **QEURO**, a Euro-pegged stablecoin designed specifically for European markets and global euro-denominated operations.

### Core Components:

- **QEURO**: Euro-pegged stablecoin with overcollateralized backing via USDC reserves
- **stQEURO**: Yield-bearing wrapper with automatic compounding mechanics
- **QTI**: Governance token with vote-escrow mechanics for protocol control
- **Dual-Pool Architecture**: Separation of user deposits from hedging operations
- **Native EUR/USD Hedging**: Integrated foreign exchange risk management

### Key Innovation:
**Leveraging USD liquidity depth** while providing **native EUR exposure** through sophisticated hedging mechanisms, enabling European users to participate in DeFi without currency risk.

## 🧠 Executive Summary

**The Challenge**: DeFi remains overwhelmingly USD-denominated, structurally excluding over 300 million European savers and institutions who operate natively in euros. This creates unnecessary currency risk and fails to capitalize on vast European capital pools.

**The Solution**: Quantillon Protocol bridges this gap through a revolutionary three-token ecosystem that leverages deep USD liquidity while providing native EUR exposure, enabling Europeans to participate in DeFi without currency risk.

**The Innovation**: By smartly combining USD collateral backing with decentralized EUR/USD hedging mechanisms, Quantillon creates a **stable euro primitive** that unlocks native European financial flows in Web3.

**The Impact**: Whether you're a developer building euro-native applications, a DAO expanding to European markets, an investor seeking euro-denominated yields, or simply curious about the future of European DeFi — Quantillon provides the infrastructure for euro-native decentralized finance.
