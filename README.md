# Overview

## 🧭 Welcome to the Quantillon Protocol Documentation

> A euro-native DeFi infrastructure — robust, compliant, and built for composability.

***

### 🌍 What is Quantillon?

**Quantillon Protocol** is a decentralized finance infrastructure designed to unlock the power of the euro in crypto ecosystems. While the USD dominates DeFi, Quantillon provides a stable, scalable, and euro-denominated solution to serve individuals, institutions, and protocols across Europe and beyond.

Built on top of **robust USD liquidity**, the protocol issues **$QEURO**, a euro stablecoin backed by stable USD reserves (e.g. USDC) with real-time risk-managed FX exposure. The protocol is governed by a decentralized community via the **$QTI** governance token.
