### 🏛️ Protocol Basics

#### **Q: What is Quantillon Protocol?**

**A:** Quantillon is a revolutionary DeFi protocol that issues **$QEURO**, the first truly scalable euro-denominated stablecoin backed by USDC. We combine **on-chain transparency**, **capital efficiency**, and **decentralized governance** through the **$QTI token** to solve the eurozone's underrepresentation in DeFi.

> **Key Innovation:** Our dual-pool architecture with Users and Hedgers creates natural peg stability while providing yield opportunities for euro-native participants.

#### **Q: How does $QEURO work?**

**A:** $QEURO is **over-collateralized** (minimum 101%) with USD-based stablecoins like USDC. Here's how it works:

* 🔐 **Minting**: Deposit accepted assets → automatically swapped to USDC → $QEURO minted at oracle price
* 🔄 **Peg Maintenance**: Maintained through delta-neutral forex hedging and liquidation mechanisms
* 💰 **Redemption**: Always redeemable 1:1 against collateral, ensuring price stability
* 📊 **Transparency**: All collateral transparently tracked on-chain via Chainlink oracles

#### **Q: Why not just use USDC or USDT directly?**

**A:** Great question! $QEURO provides several unique advantages:

| Benefit                          | $QEURO                           | Traditional USD Stablecoins |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **🇪🇺 Euro Exposure**           | ✅ Native euro denomination       | ❌ USD exposure risk         |
| **📈 Yield Generation**          | ✅ Earn while holding via staking | ❌ No native yield           |
| **🔗 DeFi Composability**        | ✅ Full DeFi integration          | ✅ Limited to USD markets    |
| **⚖️ Regulatory Clarity**        | ✅ MiCA-compliant design          | ⚠️ Regulatory uncertainty   |
| **🏛️ Decentralized Governance** | ✅ Community-controlled           | ❌ Centralized control       |

**Perfect for:** European users, dApps, DAOs, and institutions seeking euro exposure without traditional banking friction.

### 🎯 Tokenomics & Governance

#### **Q: What is the purpose of the $QTI token?**

**A:** The **$QTI token** is the governance backbone of Quantillon Protocol, designed for long-term protocol stewardship:

**🗳️ Governance Rights**

* Vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes
* Whitelist new vault variants (mQEURO, bQEURO, eQEURO)
* Control treasury allocation and Fee Switch activation
* Steer ecosystem development direction

**💰 Economic Benefits**

* Participate in protocol fee distribution (when activated)
* Access to exclusive liquidity mining rewards
* Potential token buybacks from protocol surplus
* Staking multipliers for enhanced yields

**📊 Token Distribution**

* **50%** → Community (liquidity mining, governance rewards)
* **35%** → Early backers, strategic partners, DAO treasury
* **15%** → Core development team (multi-year vesting)

#### **Q: How does the "Yield Shift" mechanism work?**

**A:** The **Yield Shift** is our innovative rebalancing engine that dynamically redistributes yield between Users and Hedgers:

**📈 When hedger participation is high:**

* More yield flows to $QEURO Users
* Incentivizes euro adoption and staking

**📉 When hedger supply is low:**

* More yield allocated to Hedgers
* Attracts delta-neutral capital for peg stability

This creates a **self-balancing ecosystem** where market forces naturally maintain protocol health without manual intervention.

### 🔒 Security & Trust

#### **Q: Is Quantillon secure?**

**A:** Security is our top priority. Here's our multi-layered approach:

**🛡️ Smart Contract Security**

* ✅ **Open source** and publicly auditable code
* ✅ **Multiple security audits** by leading firms
* ✅ **Continuous bug bounty programs**
* ✅ **Modular architecture** limiting blast radius
* ✅ **Emergency pause mechanisms** for crisis management

**📊 Oracle & Price Security**

* ✅ **Chainlink oracles** with multiple data sources
* ✅ **Circuit breakers** for anomalous price feeds
* ✅ **Real-time monitoring** of all price inputs
* ✅ **Fallback mechanisms** for oracle failures

**⚖️ Governance Security**

* ✅ **Progressive decentralization** with Foundation oversight initially
* ✅ **Time-locked proposals** preventing rushed decisions
* ✅ **Quorum requirements** ensuring broad participation
* ✅ **Multi-signature controls** on critical functions

#### **Q: What happens if there's a "black swan" event?**

**A:** Quantillon is designed for resilience across multiple failure scenarios:

* **🌊 Market Crash**: Over-collateralization and liquidation mechanisms maintain solvency
* **🔧 Smart Contract Bug**: Modular design limits exposure; emergency pause available
* **📉 DeFi Platform Failure**: Diversified vault variants reduce single-point-of-failure risk
* **💱 Extreme FX Volatility**: Delta-neutral hedging and dynamic incentives maintain peg
* **🏛️ Regulatory Changes**: MiCA-compliant design with legal entity interface
