# Market Landscape & Competitive Analysis

### The Euro Stablecoin Market: Fragmentation and Failure to Launch

Despite numerous attempts to develop euro-denominated stablecoins, none have achieved substantial market penetration or liquidity. EUROC (Circle), EURS (Stasis), EURT (Tether), and Angle's agEUR represent the most recognizable names in this segment, yet they collectively represent **less than 2%** of the total stablecoin market capitalization as of Q2 2025. Each of these projects suffers from critical structural limitations:

| Stablecoin | Issuer         | Key Limitations                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EUROC**  | Circle         | Despite the credibility of its issuer, EUROC has limited utility and suffers from low liquidity on decentralized exchanges. It also lacks yield generation mechanisms and is primarily used as a compliance showcase. |
| **EURS**   | Stasis         | EURS is a custodial stablecoin with limited adoption and high on/off-ramp costs. It is centralized and opaque, offering no native integration with DeFi protocols.                                                    |
| **EURT**   | Tether         | Lacking regulatory clarity and plagued by transparency concerns, EURT is largely avoided by institutional players.                                                                                                    |
| **agEUR**  | Angle Protocol | While technically innovative with a dynamic reserve model, agEUR has struggled with capital efficiency and scale, facing depegging events and declining user confidence.                                              |

The consistent problem across all these assets is their failure to create meaningful liquidity, yield opportunities, and DeFi integration comparable to USD stablecoins. These failings result not from lack of intent but from poor incentive alignment, limited network effects, and insufficient hedging infrastructure for EUR/USD volatility.

### USD Dominance in DeFi: A Structural Bias

As of mid-2025, **over 99% of DeFi stablecoin liquidity** is denominated in USD. The dominance of USDC and USDT on platforms like Aave, Compound, Curve, and MakerDAO creates a feedback loop: most lending, borrowing, and LP positions rely on dollar-based units of account. This has network and liquidity advantages but perpetuates the exclusion of non-USD participants.

From a European perspective, engaging in DeFi through USD-based assets introduces three layers of friction:

1. **🔄 FX risk** — EUR/USD fluctuations can nullify yield gains or exacerbate losses.
2. **💸 Operational slippage** — On-ramping EUR into USD-based DeFi typically requires high-friction conversions via centralized exchanges.
3. **📋 Regulatory and tax complexity** — Cross-currency gains may introduce additional accounting burdens and reduce fiscal clarity.

Consequently, euro-based users and institutions either remain absent from DeFi altogether or engage through inefficient intermediaries. This creates an untapped market segment, particularly among family offices, corporate treasuries, and fintech platforms seeking native euro liquidity.

### Quantillon's Competitive Edge

Quantillon Protocol is positioned to resolve the failures of previous euro stablecoins by aligning incentives and market architecture through three innovations:

**🌊 Liquidity by Design**

QEURO inherits USDC liquidity on the user side and Forex liquidity via the hedger side. This dual-channel design mitigates the need for external liquidity mining or bribing mechanisms.

**⚖️ Delta-Neutral Hedging**

Unlike existing euro stablecoins, Quantillon introduces a permissionless hedging layer that allows collateral providers to neutralize EUR/USD exposure through protocol-native instruments. This supports peg stability and institutional hedging needs.

**📈 Yield Shift Mechanism**

QEURO is not only a stablecoin but a savings instrument. By redistributing part of the yield from collateral deployment (e.g., Aave) to users and hedgers via a dynamic "Yield Shift," the protocol incentivizes long-term participation and peg maintenance.

These components create a uniquely sustainable design that addresses both supply (hedgers) and demand (euro users) sides of the market. By leveraging DeFi primitives and real-world financial theory—including FX swap economics and interest rate parity—Quantillon delivers a euro stablecoin that is liquid, scalable, and yield-generating.

> **In short, Quantillon does not merely replicate a euro version of USDC or DAI—it reengineers stablecoin economics from the ground up to serve European needs in a structurally USD-centric DeFi landscape.**
