# Conclusion & Perspectives

Quantillon Protocol embodies a pragmatic, technically rigorous, and strategically ambitious response to the eurozone's persistent underrepresentation in decentralized finance. By leveraging the deep liquidity of USD markets while enabling native euro exposure through robust hedging mechanisms, it succeeds in building a euro-denominated stablecoin infrastructure with institutional-grade architecture.

#### üéØ Strategic Summary

Quantillon introduces a new monetary layer to the European crypto ecosystem. Its architecture addresses the key shortcomings of existing euro stablecoins‚Äîliquidity scarcity, peg instability, and regulatory fragility‚Äîwhile offering competitive yields and native DeFi composability.

#### üèõÔ∏è DAO Vision & Euro-Native DeFi

Quantillon represents a blueprint for DAO-led monetary infrastructure in Europe. Over time, the DAO will gain full control over protocol parameters, treasury allocation, and collateral expansion. With Recital 22 of MiCA as a legal foundation, QEURO can emerge as the foundational euro asset across decentralized applications.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Disclaimer
