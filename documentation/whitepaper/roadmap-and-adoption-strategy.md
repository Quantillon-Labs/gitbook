### Ecosystem Development and Network Effects

Adoption is not only technical but also social and economic. Quantillon's adoption strategy includes:

**🌍 Community Growth**

Incentivized programs for ambassadors, contributors, and early adopters.

**🏢 B2B Pipelines**

Outreach to wealth managers, DAOs, family offices, and treasuries.

**🛠️ Ecosystem Grants**

For developers building QEURO-integrated products (e.g., wallets, cross-chain bridges, tax tools).

**📚 Educational Content**

Financial literacy campaigns focused on DeFi yields, euro-denominated finance, and MiCA.

> **Quantillon is not merely launching a product—it is fostering a movement. The roadmap emphasizes responsible growth, composability, and transparency to establish QEURO as the euro-native financial layer of Web3.**
