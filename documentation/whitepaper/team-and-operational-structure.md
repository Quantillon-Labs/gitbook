# Team & Operational Structure

Quantillon is driven by a multidisciplinary team combining decades of experience in software engineering, decentralized finance, macroeconomics, and digital asset management. The organizational design reflects the layered responsibilities of protocol development, governance stewardship, and institutional interfacing.

### Founding Team

**👨‍💼 Toni Cantarutti — CEO**

Toni brings over **15 years of experience** as a software architect specializing in core C++ and system-level development. His career spans R\&D roles at Intuisphere, Orange Labs, and Thermo Fisher Scientific. He is the founder of Benarius, a CeFi euro-yield platform, which laid the groundwork for Quantillon. Toni leads protocol design, team coordination, and strategic vision.

**👨‍💻 Nicolas Bellengé — CTO**

With **20 years of experience** in software engineering and project leadership, Nicolas is an expert in Web2/Web3 stack integration. He is the CEO of NBTC SAS, a company focused on the acquisition, resale, and management of crypto assets. At Quantillon, Nicolas oversees the smart contract infrastructure, full-stack development, and cybersecurity framework.

### Core Development & Product Team

Quantillon's core team includes **two full-stack blockchain developers** specializing in Solidity, DeFi integrations, and protocol-level testing. The product division includes a **UX/UI designer** and a **communications strategist** responsible for user onboarding, documentation, and market engagement.

This lean structure ensures rapid iteration while maintaining rigorous technical standards. Team roles are documented on-chain for transparency and incentivized through long-term vesting in $QTI tokens.

### Organizational Entities

To manage legal exposure, regulatory dialogue, and decentralized operations, Quantillon is structured into three synergistic entities:

**🔗 Quantillon Protocol (on-chain)**

**Fully decentralized smart contracts** governed by $QTI holders. Responsible for minting, vault logic, hedging infrastructure, and governance proposals.

**🔬 Quantillon Labs (development)**

A **legal entity** responsible for developing and launching the protocol. Initially acts as a liquidity provider and hedger, remunerated by the protocol. Labs ensures code security, DevOps, and integrations.

**🏛️ Quantillon Foundation (compliance)**

A **non-profit Swiss-style foundation** that interfaces with regulators, auditors, and legal stakeholders. It safeguards multisig access, publishes disclosures, and facilitates DAO transitions.

> **This tripartite model preserves decentralization while ensuring institutional credibility and legal defensibility—especially relevant under MiCA's evolving guidance.**

Quantillon's human capital strategy focuses on high-leverage contributors, external auditors, and community-aligned governance. The team is well-positioned to evolve into a DAO-governed protocol with scalable institutional interfaces.
