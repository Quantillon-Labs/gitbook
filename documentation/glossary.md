The French authority responsible for prudential supervision and resolution, which engages in regulatory dialogue with Quantillon.

***

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)

### aQEURO / mQEURO / bQEURO / eQEURO

Variants of QEURO vaults, each representing different collateral strategies:

* **aQEURO**: Backed by USDC deposited on Aave.
* **mQEURO**: Backed by MakerDAO vaults.
* **bQEURO**: Backed by tokenized Treasury Bills (T-Bills).
* **eQEURO**: Based on synthetic yield models.

***

### Cantillon Effect

Quantillon aims to **reverse** this effect to benefit European savers.

***

### CASP (Crypto-Asset Service Providers)

***

### CeDeFi (Centralized Decentralized Finance)

A hybrid approach combining centralized and decentralized systems, often integrating DeFi technology into centralized frameworks.

***

### Overcollateralization

A system where the value of pledged collateral exceeds the value of the issued loan or stablecoin.\
**QEURO is overcollateralized by at least 101%.**

***

### Composability

The ability of DeFi protocols to integrate and interact seamlessly, enabling the creation of complex and composable financial products.

Quantillon aims for **full DAO governance** over time.

***

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)

***

### KPI (Key Performance Indicator)

Metrics used to assess the protocol’s growth and performance.\
Examples: **TVL**, **swap volume**, **user base**.

***

### Liquidity by Design

Quantillon's strategy of leveraging **existing liquidity** (USDC and Forex) instead of building new liquidity from scratch—reducing costs and slippage.

***

### Livret A

A low-yield regulated savings product in France, often cited as an example of how European capital is passively “parked”.

***

### MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)

***

### Vaults

Risk-segmented architecture modules where users deposit collateral across various DeFi backends (e.g., Aave, MakerDAO).

***

### veQTI (Vote-Escrowed QTI)

A staking model where $QTI tokens are **locked** for a fixed time in exchange for:

* Increased voting power
* Long-term alignment incentives

***
